In many developing countries, waste management systems are inadequate, leading to open dumping(Landfills) and burning of waste, which can release harmful pollutants into the environment.Landfills are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, with the decomposition of organic waste producing methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.Approximately 2 billion tons of waste are generated globally each year, and this number is expected to double by 2025.We as humans are failed to manage the waste which is generated by us.The plastic is used so often that it has now entered in our food chain as well through aquatic life or some other sources.The cost of pollution due to the garbage will be beared by the whole world including the animals,plants and humans.

The technology can be helpful in managing our waste and taking it in some other useful manner.The waste can be used at waste to energy plants to generate electicity or we can use eco friendly products which uses thoses raw materials which can be recycled very easily.The garbage collected at these landfill sites has different types of garbage like cardboard,paper,plastic,glass,metals etc.Some of these garbage can be decomposed very easily like (cardboard and paper) and some type of garbage like plastic can be used in roads and highways construction.Glass and metals can be easily recycled and can be reshaped in some other products which can be used again by us.So we need to identify the type of garbage once we know the type of garbage it can be seprated from others and finally we can treat the garbage based upon the best procedure available for its treatment.

For this we can build a garbage detection model which will detect different type of garbage.In our case we have build a model to detect cardboard,paper,plastic,glass,metals waste.Once the garbage type is detected the different type of garbage can be differentiated with the help of it and we can then use the most optimal way to recycle the garbage.
